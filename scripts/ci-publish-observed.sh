# publish-echo-image reports success only once an image reaches Forgejo OCI.
# Every other result leaves main without one, and each arrives silently:
# skipped when test failed so the publish never ran, cancelled when a later
# push superseded it, failure when the publish itself broke. A caller reading
# the run list cannot tell those from "not applicable" without this check.
#
# This reports the consequence. It does not cure any of the three causes.
