# Reports whether main's tip is deployable, from outside any push's run.

#
# The in-run publish-observed job cannot see a cancelled publish, because a
# cancelled run cancels the observer with it. This asks the package registry
# instead, on a schedule, which is the one vantage point a torn-down run
# cannot reach.
#
# It gates on the tip rather than on every commit. A cancelled publish for an
# intermediate commit costs nothing once a later push publishes, but a tip with
# no image means there is nothing to roll out, which is the state worth waking
# someone for.
