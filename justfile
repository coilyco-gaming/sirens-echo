# Per-repo task manifest. Run `just` (or `just --list`) to see every verb.
#
# Recipes take trailing arguments directly: `just test ./internal/...`, where
# the retired form was `ward exec test -- ./internal/...`.
#
# Multi-step verbs route through scripts/task.sh, which also installs the
# commit hook on the way past and stamps SIRENS_ECHO_RUNNER so a dataset can
# name the checkout that produced it. Verbs naming their tool directly here do
# neither, which is the same split the previous manifest had.
