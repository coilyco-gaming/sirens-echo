# Features

What ships today, and where each capability is documented. The forty pages in this folder are indexed at
the end.

## Admission

- Mention-or-reply invocation with channel, thread, guild, author, and duplicate gates, plus summoning
  by an edit that newly names the service, **gated on a member edit rather than a link preview**.
- Git-tracked access policy stacking guild, channel, user, and role grants with a deny list, per-guild
  rate overrides, and CI validation.
- Per-user, per-context, and global admission control with a bounded queue, **one cooldown notice per
  window**, and bounded lookups.
- Coalescing lane folding a member's rapid comments into one turn behind **an acknowledgment per
  comment**, drained by three workers with one writer per member and a per-batch escalation ladder.

## The response service

- Deploy-selected verified role bundle for Deep, none for Echo. Neutral Sirens Echo and social CoilyCo
  profiles with independent policy roots, **a Kai-only trust boundary**, and build-time checks.
- Definition-selected history budget, skill roots, MCP roster, and issue tracker. Serialized turns with
  bounded Discord-history continuity, and whole-thread prefill inside a thread **dropping oldest first
  with the loss stated in the reply**.
- Agent Proxy loop for MCP schemas, tool calls, results, and continuation. Public Eco MCP, and a private
  Forgejo MCP fixed to this repository with issue create, close, comment, label changes, and bounded
  reads. **No Forgejo token in the Echo pod.** Arithmetic evaluated exactly in process.
- Impersonal response contract rejecting greetings, emotive emoji, banter, sign-offs, and open-ended
  offers. Plain-text replies with one style-aware repair, grounding checks reading first-person and
  passive claims alike **over prose with links masked out**, and neutral-style validation where
  selected.
- Appended canonical links for every issue a turn observed or filed, **built only from returned tool
  results**. Reply refusal for any identifier the process holds, derived from configuration at boot,
  **admitted by shape and matched by value rather than spelling**.
- Caller-supplied history marked as asserted rather than observed, on both private ingresses. Harness
  reactions for acceptance, a tool round, a failure, and a refusal, **applied before the model call and
  unable to fail a turn**.
- A worklog element on a long Discord turn, one row per tool call resolving in place, **degrading to
  stacked notice lines where the embed permission is absent**.
- Oversized tool results saved to the requester's scratchpad instead of being truncated away, and
  replies over the send budget attached whole as a file, **with every failure falling back to
  truncation**. One assembly step for every service-authored suffix, **shortening the answer so no
  suffix is budgeted against another**.
- Uploaded text stored in the requester's scratchpad, **from a Discord CDN address only and decided by
  its bytes**. Soft-reference replies with every Discord mention disabled, and an undelivered reply
  reported to the member once and never retried.
- Private HTTP entrypoint over the same turn path, served as JSON and as an MCP tool, with W3C tracing
  and Discord's admission policy. Transport-neutral CoilyCo profile with **no assumed domain, MCP,
  automatic issue tracking, or default write surface**.

## Observability

- Transport-aware ingress and joined turn traces end to end, with trace-correlated metadata logs
  carrying byte counts **and no member or model text**. Logs exported over OTLP beside traces and
  metrics sharing one `service.name`, **and kept on stdout so `kubectl logs` survives a SigNoz outage**.
- Turn, latency, model-call, tool-call, admission, and failure metrics, plus a build-time closed
  exception catalog tagged by stage, outcome, and fault, **with caller and service faults split per code
  so a new one cannot be silently unclassified**.
- A Discord turn span carrying the author, guild, channel, thread, and message ids, **and no direct
  message contributing any of them**. A gateway heartbeat counting observed, admitted, and replied, **so
  a quiet guild and a stopped ingress differ**.
- Metrics-only liveness and non-generating route readiness. A metadata-only tool-call trajectory
  mirrored into Temporal Cloud, **off the turn's path and counted when it drops**. Workspace command
  execution and attachment ingest recorded by verb and outcome, **with no arguments, output, filename,
  or content**.

## Configuration and deployment

- Deploy-selected definition, ingress switch, instance, and Agent Proxy route, with independent
  community and general-purpose definitions **in one immutable image**.
- Deployment-owned Forgejo MCP URL in Echo, repository-scoped token only in the MCP pod, and
  ExternalSecret injection **with no pod AWS permission**.
- Deploy-selected job store: in-memory, a mounted directory, or Postgres. Singleton k3s Deployment, and
  full-source-SHA images published to Forgejo OCI. **A main push that publishes no image fails the run**,
  and an hourly `image-coverage` workflow asks the registry whether main's tip has an image.

## Development gates

- `just` recipes for build, policy verification, prompt snapshots, format, vet, test, tidy, run,
  per-profile evaluation, failure-rate measurement, and full pre-commit.
- Every boundary this deployment holds **declared once** in `eval/boundaries.yaml`, with
  `just boundaries-check` failing when a declaration no longer resolves.
- Forgejo CI builds, checks policy, vets, tests, and runs pre-commit. Structure, skills, links, modules,
  comments, secrets, and prompt all validated. **Entrypoint failures logged as severity-carrying JSON,
  never bare stderr.**

## Deliberate exclusions

Echo has **no moderation, account, role, announcement, Forgejo edit, delete, reaction, cross-repository,
or ambient-channel surface**, sends no unsolicited direct message, and owns no web or mobile UI.
