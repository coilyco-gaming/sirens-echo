# Deployment

The image this repository publishes, the k3s lifecycle deploy owns, and what an operator proves first.

## The application image

The root `Dockerfile` builds `cmd/sirens-echo` on the full AOS release image, and during the build the
tracked definitions, repo-local policy roots, and the reference access policy are loaded and checked for
their selected contracts. **`just test` proves that check passes with only the files the build context
carries.** The final non-root image contains both definitions and the policy roots; **it loads no AOS or
Agent Compose context and does not add lore.** A main push publishes
`forgejo.coilysiren.me/coilyco-gaming/sirens-echo:<full-source-sha>`, the publisher using an isolated
Docker config, pushing one immutable tag, and proving the remote manifest exists. **This application
repository publishes an artifact only. It holds no cluster credential and never reaches into the
deployment layer.**

**A pull request builds the same Dockerfile without publishing**, so a build-context fault fails the
review rather than the merge. That job container gets no `DOCKER_HOST` and no mounted socket, and
dockerd listens on `0.0.0.0:2375` in the runner pod, **so the daemon answers on the container's default
gateway and the script has to work out which address that is**. `scripts/lib/docker-host.sh` derives an
inherited `DOCKER_HOST`, then the default gateway decoded from `/proc/net/route`, then the conventional
`172.17.0.1`, then the socket path. **Deriving the gateway ahead of the hardcoded address is what lets
the bridge renumber, which it has** - one run built against `172.18.0.1`. `scripts/ci-docker-probe.sh`
runs only when the build fails and reads the same candidate list, **so it can never report on an address
the build would not have tried**. The build records the address it settled on and the probe leads with
that, because **most failures are Dockerfile faults, and a bare list of candidates with some marked
unreachable reads like a partial outage that did not happen**. The probe never fails, because its caller
wants the report rather than a second red step.

## The k3s lifecycle

`coilyco-bridge/deploy/services/sirens-echo/` owns the namespace and Echo's SSM-backed ExternalSecret, a
private repository-fixed Ward MCP workload with its own ExternalSecret, a one-replica `Recreate`
Deployment, a private ClusterIP Service and Tailscale sidecar, resource and container security bounds,
OTLP/HTTP access to the SigNoz collector, the shared rollout values and path-scoped workflow, and the
rollback instructions.

**The deploy layer may run multiple instances from the same immutable image**, owning each instance's
definition path, ingress switch, Agent Proxy route, namespace, tailnet identity, and telemetry name.
**The deployment name is a stable routing identity, not the model's domain or policy.** `Recreate`
prevents two Gateway sessions from overlapping during a rollout. **The private Forgejo MCP holds the
only Forgejo token** and exposes only a ClusterIP Service, with no public, tailnet, certificate, DNS, or
NodePort route. The deploy repository pins published full source SHAs and pulls them with the separate
read-only `forgejo-registry` credential, and **the rollout makes the Forgejo MCP ready before it updates
Echo**. The deploy layer can return Echo to zero replicas **without changing the source repository,
skillpack, or SSM parameters**.

## The operator gate

Before raising replicas, an authorized operator confirms the private intake tracker records the selected
Community model, stores it at `/sirens-echo/agent-proxy-model`, confirms Agent Proxy advertises it, that
`just policy-check` verifies both response policies, and that the reviewed full-SHA image exists in
Forgejo OCI. Then: **the issue token exists without printing it**, only the private Forgejo MCP
ExternalSecret references it, the Discord token and `#bots` identifier resolve **without printing either
value**, Message Content is enabled with Echo limited to view, read history, and send in `#bots`, deploy
uses exact image SHAs with its read-only pull credential, and Agent Proxy, Eco MCP, the private Forgejo
MCP, and SigNoz are reachable. **Echo receives the private MCP's ClusterIP URL but no Forgejo
credential, and no secret belongs in a tracked file, shell history, issue, or chat.**

The operator runs `just eval-echo`, lands `REPLICAS=1`, and summons Echo in `#bots`. Verification
requires all four evaluation cases passing including live Eco status; the neutral-capability case
containing **no greeting, emoji, first-person voice, self-description, banter, sign-off, or open-ended
offer**; Echo responding only to a direct summon and pinging nobody; a second summon able to refer to
the first exchange; SigNoz showing one joined turn trace; trace-correlated logs retaining safe metadata
and byte counts **without prompt, model, tool, or reply bodies**; turn, latency, model, tool, and
failure metrics existing; the unknown case creating or reusing an ordinary unlabeled issue **containing
no identity, Discord identifier, quote, or private data**; the Forgejo MCP publishing only its reviewed
issue and label tools; and **Echo's container carrying the MCP URL and no `FORGEJO_TOKEN`**.

**Missing SSM values fail before either workload becomes ready.** Agent Proxy, MCP, loop,
response-contract, or validation failures return a neutral retry reply, **invalid output never reaches
Discord or Forgejo**, and the pod gets no AWS credentials. **Forgejo failure never makes Echo claim an
issue exists**: the answer still posts while logs record the failed follow-through. To roll back, the
operator restores the prior deploy commit, or leaves Echo at zero replicas, and **reruns evaluation
before restoring one replica**.

## The CoilyCo gate

The Sirens Deep workload selects the hosted DeepSeek route and loads the CoilyCo definition, receiving
its own instance, namespace, tailnet hostname, and non-reusable Tailscale key. Its Discord ingress
refuses every guild, channel, and account its access policy does not name, and **it holds no Forgejo
secret, because that credential lives only in the MCP pod**. **Separate instance and separate namespace
is the point rather than an implementation detail**: the two profiles differ in what they will talk
about, **and a shared workload would make that difference a configuration value instead of a boundary**.

Before live rollout an operator verifies the immutable image and route registries, applies the
Terraform-managed Tailscale service entry and namespace RBAC, then deploys the reviewed values. **Tailnet
HTTP verification must prove the general profile answers unrelated topics without assuming a game or
community domain and without weakening truth, privacy, or action grounding. Both halves matter**: a
general profile that refuses unrelated topics has not generalised, **and one that answers them by
dropping a grounding rule has traded the wrong thing for the breadth**.

## Checking a file deploy owns

Two of Echo's configuration files live in the deploy repository as Kubernetes ConfigMaps, **and anything
here that validates one has to know that, because the pod never sees the shape the repository stores**.
Kubernetes mounts the value under `data:` as a file, so **the runtime loader receives a bare document
and is right to expect one**, while an offline checker reads the wrapper. **The two inputs are different
and both are real.**

It failed twice, in opposite directions. `LoadAccessPolicy` uses `KnownFields(true)`, so a ConfigMap's
own keys are unknown and it **errors**, so the gate built on it rejected every policy deploy has while
passing every fixture. `LoadMCPRoster` had no such strictness, so the same wrapper parsed, `mcpServers`
was simply absent, and it returned **zero servers and no error** - and an empty roster is a legitimate
state, **so a wrong path and a deliberate no-tool deployment looked identical**. **The loud one cost
half a day of noticing. The quiet one cost a deployment its tools with nothing in a log.**

**Read the inner document, and let deploy extract it.** Unwrapping `data:` inside the checker **is wrong
twice**: it puts Kubernetes knowledge in the repository that does not own k3s, and it makes the checker
accept a shape the runtime never sees, **so the checker and the pod stop agreeing about what a valid
file is**. **Refuse the wrapper with a message that names it**, and **test against a real file**,
because a fixture written from the format's documentation describes the mounted shape, **the one input
the checker will never be handed**. **Do not iron out how the loaders differ**: `LoadAccessPolicy`
narrows a schema this repository owns, so strict decoding is free, while `LoadMCPRoster` cannot, the
`mcpServers` shape being shared with mcporter, Claude Code, and Codex. **Same wrong file, two refusals,
both correct for their format.**

## Which commit is answering

The publish script already derives the full source sha to tag the image, and now passes that same value
as a build argument stamped into a package variable with a linker assignment: **one source of truth,
used twice**. **`.git` is deliberately not copied into the build stage**, because letting the toolchain
stamp `vcs.revision` would add the whole repository to the build context to recover one string, **and it
would make the revision depend on how the tree was checked out rather than on what the publisher
tagged**. A local build passes no argument, so the revision is empty and `BuildRevision` returns an
empty string - **the honest answer for a build that carried no revision, and why readiness records the
value rather than a placeholder: an empty field is visibly different from a wrong one**. **Naming a
commit does not let the process read that commit**: a source link is still current source rather than
the code that answered, unless the revision is named alongside it, and that claim is bound to the
Dockerfile by a test.
