# Sirens Echo configuration and evaluation

## YAML agent and model configuration

`agent/sirens-echo.yaml` pins the neutral Community policy.
`agent/sirens-deep.yaml` selects the social CoilyCo general-purpose policy for
the existing HTTP workload. Each definition pins audit attribution, response
style, optional channel, history budget, local policy roots, optional MCP
roster, and optional automatic issue tracker. Neither pins a backend model or
loads a behavioral role or seat. The audit role is not added to the model
prompt.

Agent Proxy is the inference transport. Deployment reads the selected
`<namespace>/<alias>` route from `/sirens-echo/agent-proxy-model` and passes it
through without a source default, and Echo uses that value for inference and
route readiness alike.

Every model round requests OpenAI-compatible JSON object mode at temperature
zero, over the selected repo-local policy, untrusted bounded history, and the
current request. Echo attempts one same-conversation, style-aware repair with
tools disabled, then fails closed before Discord or an automatic issue write.

`SIRENS_ECHO_DEFINITION` selects the tracked definition. Discord ingress is on
by default. `SIRENS_ECHO_DISCORD_ENABLED=false` removes the token and channel
requirements while retaining the private HTTP turn path. `SIRENS_ECHO_INSTANCE`
sets a distinct lowercase service name for telemetry.

An MCP entry has either a literal `url` or a deployment-owned `url_env`.
The Sirens Echo Forgejo entry uses `SIRENS_ECHO_FORGEJO_MCP_URL`, so the
source definition selects the server while deploy owns its cluster-local
endpoint. The CoilyCo definition intentionally has no MCP entries.

The definition's `channel` is the prompt's boundary label, not the routing key.
It must be empty or a `#channel-name` the grounding validator also accepts. An
empty channel is transport-neutral and valid for Discord and HTTP alike, because
deployment owns routing. An empty MCP roster is valid, and `issue_tracker` must
name a configured MCP server when present.

`SIRENS_ECHO_ACCESS_POLICY` names the deployment's tracked allowlist file,
which stacks guild, channel, member, and role grants with a deny list. Without
it, `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID`, `DISCORD_GUILD_IDS`, and
`SIRENS_ECHO_DISCORD_DM_ENABLED` synthesize the equivalent. See
[the access policy](sirens-echo-access.md) and
[contexts](sirens-echo-contexts.md).

Admission limits, queue depth, and both turn timeouts are configurable. See
[admission](sirens-echo-admission.md) and [HTTP](sirens-echo-http.md).

## Knowledge gaps and corrections

For a definition with `issue_tracker`, an unanswered question produces a
`knowledge-gap` draft and an explicit correction produces a `correction`
draft. These values affect only the issue title prefix. The runtime applies no
labels. A definition without `issue_tracker` must return `issue: null` and
state uncertainty in the reply.

The runtime removes Discord links, mention syntax, and long identifiers from
drafts. It requires a summary without member identity, handles, raw quotes,
secrets, or personal details. The automatic reporter calls the guarded
Forgejo MCP's HTTP tool projection to reuse an exact-title open issue or create
an ordinary issue. A reviewed change updates the local skill and regression
case.

## Boundaries and evaluation

Echo's Discord token needs only `#bots` visibility, history, and reply
permissions. The pod receives a cluster-local MCP URL and no Forgejo token.
The separate MCP pod receives an exact-repository token and a guardfile that
publishes only the reviewed issue and label tools.

`ward exec policy-check` verifies both tracked response policies. `ward exec
test` exercises the offline harness, the zero-tool CoilyCo profile, and an
official MCP server fixture.
`ward exec eval-echo` omits environment-backed MCP servers and gives each
unknown-answer, correction, live Eco, and neutral-capability case its own
five-minute deadline, without a Discord or Forgejo write.
