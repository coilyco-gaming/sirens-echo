# Composing a lane identity

Both lanes compose an Agent Compose role bundle. Deep composes `creator` and takes its voice from it,
Echo composes `ops` and does not ([role and voice](sirens-echo-identity.md)).

## The allowlist is a role graph

`agent/compose/roles.kdl` is the one tracked allowlist, in agent-compose's role-graph format, with
globs. **It is purely additive**: it grants a role its skills and does not decide which roles exist. The
roster does that and the build bakes a bundle per roster role, so a role with no entry composes the
roster identity alone. `agent/compose/request.kdl` is the second tracked file, and **only
`declaration=` is permitted**: with `root=`, the source repository's own `.agents/roles.kdl` decides,
and agentic-os-kai's creator role deliberately binds Kai's career, job-search, and LinkedIn context,
because that role serves Kai rather than an agent answering strangers. The declaration is generated,
its `path="skills/<name>"` mechanically derived.

`cmd/sirens-echo-compose` expands the graph and fails when a pattern reaches a name in
`DeniedComposedSkills`, matches nothing, or globalizes a private repository. **An empty selector hides
an upstream rename, so it is an error.** Every admitted source lives in the public
`coilyco-flight-deck/agentic-os`, under that repository's `docs/composed-house-taste.md` placement rule,
and **the graph declares no provider repositories**, so sources reach a bundle through the request's
declarations and a globalized provider would bypass that review.
`internal/community/compose_test.go` re-runs those failures plus `root=` usage and tracked build output,
with the deny list in `composepolicy.go` beside the expander, **so build and suite enforce one list.**

`scripts/stage-compose-sources.sh` reads the roster for the role list, runs the generator per role, and
stages each admitted `COMPOSED.md` as `SKILL.md` beside a written declaration, because a declaration's
paths resolve beneath its own directory. That staged tree is build output, removed on exit. The image
clones the catalogue at `AOS_CATALOG_REF`, **which floats on `main` by design**, so reproducing an older
bundle means overriding the build arg. At runtime `composed: true` makes a bundle mandatory and
`SIRENS_ECHO_ROLE` selects which one loads, so flipping the role needs no rebuild, while **a missing or
unreadable bundle stops the process**: a profile that asks for an identity never answers without one.

## Reviewing a wider compile

The image bakes a bundle from the public catalogue it can reach. A layer holding catalogues this build
cannot read composes the same allowlist against all of them, so the wider result is reviewable alongside
the shipped one, and **neither compile replaces the other**. It runs from the image itself with
catalogues mounted read-only, so **it is this repository's expander over this repository's graph**:
every rule above still applies and the other layer contributes checkouts and delivery, never policy.
Two rules only the wider set makes visible: **a name owned by two catalogues is an error rather than a
silent first-wins**, and a pattern naming a denied source **exactly** is fatal while a family glob that
merely brushes one drops that member and prints it, without which `personal-preference-*` would become
unusable the moment a catalogue holding the denied `personal-preference-social` is present.

## The per-role selection record

`agent/rendered/roles/<role>.bundle.txt` records what each baked role selected: role skill, model tier,
personalities, sources, and the sorted skill set as `<source>/<skill>`. **No bodies and no digests**,
because the catalogue ref floats on `main`, so a record built from bodies would go stale on every
upstream commit and redden `main` for a reason nobody here can act on. What does move it is a role
gaining or losing a skill, exactly the change that should be reviewed. CI bakes the bundles in the
`test` job and the image build checks the same thing again over the bundles it ships: **the second stops
a bad image, the first tells you in seconds rather than two thirds of the way through a build**
(sirens-echo#788). A record most often drifts because the branch was cut before a composed-sources
change landed on `main`, so the merge is the remedy and the failure names it first. Loading the bundles
also renders and validates each role's prompt, because a bundle that failed to compose would ship as a
quietly neutral agent and one filed under the wrong slug would make `SIRENS_ECHO_ROLE` select the wrong
identity. **Prompt sizes are printed per role and never gated.**

`just role-drift-check` bakes and checks in one step, the gate CI runs, and it bakes to a scratch
directory it removes, **because pre-commit walks the filesystem and a baked bundle is a tree of skill
files those hooks then read as this repository's own**. `just compose-bundles`, `role-snapshot`, and
`role-snapshot-check` work against `agent/bundles` and need `AOS_CATALOG`. Read a diff here beside the
allowlist diff: `roles.kdl` says what a role **may** have, this says what it **got**.

## Who the agents belong to

Sirens Discord is the community. Coilyco Gaming is a separate organization holding a staffing and
product contract with it, the Robotics Division is the part of Coilyco Gaming that contract is with, and
Echo and Deep are that division (sourced from Kai on sirens-echo#806). Every surface naming both
organizations had to improvise the connection, and **two agents improvising the same relationship
separately is the drift this prevents**. So it lives in `.agents/skills/coilyco-org`, **the only local
skill root the two profiles share**, which makes "both agents read the same text" a property a test can
hold. The prompt carries one line naming the division.

**The separation is the load-bearing part.** An agent is never Sirens Discord staff, and Sirens Discord
staff are never Coilyco Gaming employees: either half alone is a different and wrong claim. The contract
exists and its terms are not something to disclose, and nothing in the source names a person, account,
or internal system.

## Recognising a counterpart agent

Deep can tell whether the account it is answering is an agent or a person. **Discord marks bot accounts,
and that flag is ground truth costing nothing**, whereas guessing from writing style would be a worse
version of the problem, because anyone can write "I am an agent" and a member who does must not become
one. So recognition reads `Author.Bot` and nothing else, asserted in tests rather than assumed.

Bot authors were rejected outright, so recognition required admitting them, which widens the summon
surface, so it is **opt-in by name**: `agents.allow` lists the counterpart accounts answered, empty
answers none, which is the shipped posture, and Deep never answers itself. **A named counterpart is
admitted, not trusted**, passing the same channel and guild gates a member does. Two agents each
answering the other is a runaway, so consecutive agent-authored turns in one channel are capped, a human
turn resets the run, **a capped exchange does not resume by waiting so the cap is not a speed limit**, a
quiet channel forgets, and the bound is per channel. The check runs before admission spends anything.

An agent-authored line is marked in the turn context as `- Sirens Echo (an agent, not a person):`, with
a matching sentence naming the requester. **A human turn gains no marking at all**, because an
annotation that is sometimes absent is more useful than one that is sometimes wrong, and the member's
message itself is untouched per the final-user-turn rule. **What deliberately does not change is
behaviour**: no disclosure line, no register change, no altered trust. An admitted counterpart widens
the requester set beyond one account, so `CheckExecutionAdmission` refuses execution while one is
allowed. Both refusals log without an identifier, as `discord.agent.ignored` and
`discord.exchange.bounded`.
