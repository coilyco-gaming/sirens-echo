# Features: cross-repo tooling and release

This repository uses `docs/features-release-tooling.md` as the durable
cross-reference for the catalog entry points in `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and
`docs/FEATURES.md`.

The release and validation surfaces stay separate:

- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` pins the shared agentic-os validation suite.
- `.forgejo/workflows/ci.yml` runs the repository build, tests, and validation.
- Main pushes publish the full-source-SHA Sirens Echo image to Forgejo
  OCI only after the test job passes.
- `coilyco-bridge/deploy` owns the read-only pull credential, k3s rollout, and
  rollback.
