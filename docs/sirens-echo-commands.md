# Structured commands

Free text is the right interface for conversation and the wrong one for consequential actions. "Deploy
the thing" and "deploy the other thing" are one paraphrase apart, and a natural-language turn gives the
harness no structural way to tell them apart before acting. **Commands add a structured path, not a
replacement for the conversational one.**

## The schema is an authority boundary

Two deploy-repository issues failed the same way: the surrounding tooling bounds tool **names** and not
tool **arguments**. Commands are the first place this harness owns an argument schema itself, so the
schema is treated as authority rather than input validation.

* An **undeclared argument is refused**, never ignored, because ignoring one lets a caller believe it
  took effect.
* Every string carries a **length bound**, defaulted rather than optional. A value naming a thing
  carries **choices**, the tightest bound available; one that cannot be a fixed set carries a `pattern`.
* A command **submits exactly one job kind**, and that kind must be declared, so the command surface
  cannot outgrow the job surface.
* The declaration is **validated at startup**, so a malformed command fails before a caller reaches it.

**The same declaration renders Discord's options and binds the incoming arguments**, so the advertised
schema and the enforced one cannot drift.

## A command is a summon path

Discord routes an interaction to the bot because the user picked it, not because they mentioned anyone,
**which bypasses the mention gate by construction** (#127). So a command passes the gates a message
passes, in the same order: access policy first, then admission. **A command reaches nothing a message
from the same caller in the same place could not.** Registration is a **write** to Discord's API needing
the `applications.commands` scope, so it is off unless `SIRENS_ECHO_DISCORD_COMMANDS` says otherwise.
Every path answers with a notice, so a command never ends in silence.

## Thread binding

Once work is durable, a follow-up like "cancel that" needs a referent, and the thread is the natural
one. The binding lives **on the job record** as `Origin.ThreadID`, so resolving is a lookup of a
recorded fact rather than an inference from recent history, **and the record is the single source of
truth rather than a second index that can drift**. It is **singular in both directions**: a thread
cannot be bound to a second job and a job cannot be repointed at another thread, while rebinding the
same pair is idempotent so a retry is safe. `job-status` and `job-cancel` take an optional job id and
fall back to the binding, an explicit id always wins, and outside a bound thread with no id the command
says it has no referent rather than guessing. **A job binds to the thread it was started in, and only to
a thread**, because binding a channel would make it resolve to one arbitrary job of many.

A command carries **no per-requester authority**: every job runs under pod-level authority regardless of
who asked (#145). The principal is recorded, and **recording is not granting**.

## Publishing the commands

A slash command has three parts: a declaration, a handler, and a registration with Discord. This
repository had the first two and not the third, so **every command it ships was unreachable even with
the deployment switch on**. **Registration goes per guild, to each guild the access policy admits**,
because a global registration appears in **every** guild the bot is in, including ones the policy
refuses, where the commands would be visible, invocable, and answered with `not permitted here`,
**advertising a summon path this deployment does not offer**. A deployment admitting no guild registers
nowhere and says so rather than falling back to global.

The write is a **bulk overwrite per guild**, so the published set is exactly the declared set and a
command removed from `JobCommands()` disappears instead of lingering as an invocable ghost. **Failure is
never fatal**: a guild that refuses the write is logged as `discord.commands.failed` and the loop
continues, with the first error returned at the end. It runs on `discord.ready`, and **an install
predating the `applications.commands` scope correction has to be re-authorised** first.

## A server prompt as a slash command

An MCP server publishes prompts and Discord publishes slash commands. The mapping is mechanical and the
constraints are not, because **a prompt name is server-supplied and satisfies none of Discord's shape by
construction**. A malformed command fails the **whole registration**, so one server's prompt would cost
every other command, which makes refusing a single prompt the cheaper failure. A name that cleans to
nothing is refused, so is a missing description, so are more arguments than Discord allows. **Truncation
is the one repair**, for an over-long description, because a long description is still a true one. An
empty description is refused rather than filled from the name, because a command whose description
restates its own name tells a member nothing. The name mapping lower-cases, replaces separators with
hyphens, drops anything Discord refuses, and trims.

**The part that is not mechanical**: a prompt is user-selected instruction reaching the model through a
structured channel, the same class as an uploaded file, data the turn may read and never instructions it
obeys. No filter separates a prompt that describes an instruction from one that issues it, so **the
bound is posture rather than detection**.

`CommandFromPrompt` has no production caller and **that is the intended state, not an abandonment**. It
is the mapping half of sirens-echo#127, open with Kai's approval recorded. The access-policy gap is not
what holds it: the reference policy names all six summon paths, slash commands included, and
`onInteraction` puts an interaction through the same `access.Evaluate` a mention takes. What is left is
that registration is a live API call whose failure mode is a malformed set in a real guild, that **the
promotable-prompt allowlist does not exist yet** (a prompt is not a command until this repository says
it is, and its argument schema is declared here rather than taken from the publishing server), and that
`SIRENS_ECHO_DISCORD_COMMANDS` defaults false. The harder problem underneath is that **an interaction
must be answered in three seconds and a model turn takes minutes**, so a prompt command needs a deferred
response or the job path (sirens-echo#884).

## /mcps

`/mcps` reports the MCP servers this deployment reaches and the tools each advertises. It takes no
arguments and submits no job.

**It reads what the process reached, not what the file declares.** The roster file names servers,
whether one answered is a different fact, and **the two come apart exactly when someone needs this
command**. So the reply is built from the discovered tool set with the configured roster supplying the
names, and three states stay distinct because collapsing them hides the interesting one: `name (n):
tools`, `name: no tools` (answered, advertising nothing), and `name: did not answer this turn`.

**It carries no addresses.** An MCP entry holds a URL, a transport, and an environment map, none of
which is rendered: a name is a fact about the deployment, an address is an identifier, and a test
asserts the absence. **The reply is ephemeral**, because introspection belongs to whoever asked and
Echo's channel carries members who did not. The declaration carries that flag rather than the handler,
so the refusal paths inherit it and **a denied `/mcps` does not become the public event the command was
avoiding**.

`runCommand` answers it above the job guard, because reporting the tool surface is not job work. The
reply is cut to fit one interaction and says so when it cut something, since **a silently short list is
indistinguishable from a short roster**, the failure this command exists to prevent.
