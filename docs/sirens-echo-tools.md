# Runtime MCP tools

Each source-controlled definition owns its MCP roster and optional issue tracker. The Echo community
definition contains public Eco MCP and an environment-backed private Forgejo MCP URL: **Echo sends no
credential to the private MCP**, and the separate MCP workload holds its Forgejo token. The CoilyCo
definition selects a Steam reader and the same Forgejo MCP and names no issue tracker, **so a write
happens because the model chose a tool**: general-purpose describes topic scope, not universal mutation
authority.

## Tool loop

When a definition configures MCP servers, the harness opens every session, lists each published tool,
description, and input schema, exposes each model name as `<server>__<tool>`, sends those schemas with
the Agent Proxy request, executes valid model-requested tools, renders each result as text, appends the
calls and results, then continues. **An empty roster skips discovery and sends no tools.** Final content can be
an OpenAI-compatible string, text-part array, or text object.

The harness rejects empty, colliding, or overlong model-facing tool names; calls missing an identifier
or function name; calls to tools absent from the roster; arguments that are not JSON objects; a response with neither tool calls nor usable content; and more than six rounds. **A
server that fails to connect or list contributes no tools and the turn goes on with the rest, named to
the model so it reports the gap.** Only an unreachable roster stops the turn, a name collision stays
fatal, an invocation failure ends the turn with the tool-failure notice, and an MCP error result is
grounded data the model self-corrects from **once**: a failed tool is replayed, not re-called (#943).

The in-process fixture proves schema discovery, a tool-call-only first response, continuation, alternate
content forms, and that **a tool which never answers fails on the call bound rather than the
turn's**. The live Echo evaluation requires an `eco__get_eco_server_status` call and no writes.

## Harness tools

Almost every tool Echo offers comes from a rostered MCP server. **A harness tool is the exception: the
harness itself answers the call.** A tool listing is held for an hour, and **the thing best
placed to notice it is wrong is the model that failed to find a tool it expected**, so
`harness__refresh_tools` lets it say so. It marks every rostered
server for re-reading and dials nothing, so twenty calls cost one listing.

## The read_skill tool

**A skill's references left the prompt**, read on demand (#859). `SKILL.md` stays inline as the index,
and **a reference is fetchable unless it declares `inline: always`**, which the refusal-shaping ones do.

## The calculate tool

**Every number Echo produced herself was predicted rather than calculated** (#916), fine for "roughly a
third" and not for a total or a unit price. `calculate` evaluates `+ - * / ^`, parentheses and a
trailing `%`, and **nothing else**: the grammar has no identifiers and no calls, so no expression
reaches anything. **Exact rather than floating point**, so `0.1 + 0.2` is `0.3`, and a result that is
not a decimal is rounded **and says so**, the exact fraction beside it. The expression is echoed with
the answer. In process rather than a twelfth roster server, and registered unconditionally.

## The fetch tool

A read-only HTTPS GET. **The fetching is easy, the allowlist is the feature.** It runs inside the
cluster, so unbounded it reaches the tailnet, other services' internals, and cloud metadata, **and the model is precisely the component an attacker
gets to talk to**: a tool that fetches any URL a model can be persuaded to fetch is server-side request
forgery with a conversational interface. `SIRENS_ECHO_FETCH_HOSTS` is a comma-separated allowlist, and **empty
offers no tool at all**: no schema in the prompt, nothing to be talked into.

* **A wildcard covers subdomains and nothing else.** `*.mozilla.com` matches `www.mozilla.com` and
  `a.b.mozilla.com`, **not** `mozilla.com`, which is a separate entry. It is not a suffix test: the
  leading dot is part of the comparison, so `mozilla.com.evil.example` is refused, and a pattern with a
  misplaced or missing star matches nothing rather than everything.
* **Exact host match otherwise**, not a suffix, because `host.evil.example` is a different host a suffix
  check would accept and registering that domain costs an attacker nothing. **HTTPS only.**
* **Private addresses refused at dial time**, not by reading the URL. An allowlisted hostname can
  resolve to an internal address, deliberately or by accident, and a check that only reads the hostname
  never sees it. Loopback, private ranges, link-local, unspecified, and carrier-grade NAT are refused at
  connection time. **CGNAT is named separately because Go's `IsPrivate` is RFC1918 only**, so
  `100.64.0.0/10` reads as public to every other predicate, and that range is the tailnet.
* **Redirects refused**: a redirect is a destination the allowlist never saw.
* **A page over the cap is marked, not silently cut.** The read takes one byte past the limit, so a page
  that fits is distinguishable from one that does not, and an oversize body returns what it fetched plus
  a truncation line, seam repaired to a rune boundary. **A half document the model cannot tell from a
  whole one is answered from with ordinary confidence.**

**GET only.** A tool that writes is a different authority and should be requested on its own terms. A
fetched page is untrusted text entering the prompt, and **the allowlist bounds where it comes from and
says nothing about what it says**, so an approved host serving hostile instructions is still open.

## What happens to a large result

One tool result is capped at 8 KiB before it re-enters the prompt, so a round of parallel calls cannot
inflate the context past the model's budget. **The cap is not the interesting part, what happens to the
rest is.** The full result stays on the executed-tool record for telemetry and grounding, but only the
capped copy reaches the model, so everything past the cut used to be unreachable: **a large payload was
silently beheaded and the model answered from its first 8 KiB with no way to know more existed.**

Now, when a result is trimmed and the deployment mounts a scratchpad, the runtime writes the whole
result to the requester's own scratchpad and appends a line naming the file and the true byte count, so
the model can `scratch_read` or `scratch_search` it. **The save goes through the `scratch_write` tool
rather than the filesystem**, so path confinement, the per-file limit, the per-requester quota, and
attribution all apply as for a model-requested write, and saves are numbered per turn so a second call
to the same tool cannot overwrite the first. **Every failure falls back rather than failing
the turn**: no scratchpad, a result over the per-file limit, or a partition at quota each leave a
trimmed result carrying the truncation marker, because **losing the remainder is much better than losing
the answer**. The file name is built from the tool's own name with everything outside letters, digits,
hyphen, and underscore removed, under a single `tool-output` directory, because **a tool name is
server-supplied and can never reach the filesystem as a path**.

**A spent tool budget answers rather than discards.** A turn reaching the tool-round ceiling used to
fail outright, discarding every result the rounds returned and telling the member the backend was
unavailable, and both halves were wrong. Now the tools are withdrawn once the last round's results are
in and one further call asks for an answer from what was gathered, instructed to say plainly what could
not be determined and to claim no result no tool returned. **Withdrawing after the results land rather
than on the next request costs no extra model call and keeps the six-round ceiling exactly true.** If
the outer model-call budget is also spent, the turn ends with the rounds-spent notice.
