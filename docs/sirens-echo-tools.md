# Runtime MCP tools

Each source-controlled definition owns its own MCP roster and optional
automatic issue tracker.

The Sirens Echo community definition contains public Eco MCP and an
environment-backed private Forgejo MCP URL. Eco needs no client credential or
tailnet identity. Echo sends no credential to the private MCP. The separate
MCP workload holds its Forgejo token.

The CoilyCo general-purpose definition selects a Steam reader and the same
repository-fixed Forgejo MCP Echo uses. It names no automatic issue tracker, so
a write happens because the model chose a tool, never because a turn ended.
General-purpose describes topic scope, not universal mutation authority.

## Tool loop

When a definition configures MCP servers, the harness:

1. Opens every configured MCP session.
2. Lists each published tool, description, and input schema.
3. Exposes each model name as `<server>__<tool>`.
4. Sends those schemas with the Agent Proxy request.
5. Executes valid model-requested tools.
6. Renders each result as text, appends the calls and results, then continues.

An empty roster skips discovery and sends no tools. Agent Proxy can return a
response containing only tool calls when tools exist. Final content can use an
OpenAI-compatible string, text-part array, or text object. Continuation stops
after six tool rounds.

## Validation and failure

The harness rejects:

- Empty, colliding, or overlong model-facing tool names
- Tool calls missing an identifier or function name
- Calls to tools absent from the discovered roster
- Tool arguments that are not JSON objects
- A response with neither tool calls nor usable content
- More than six tool rounds

A server that fails to connect or list contributes no tools and the turn goes on
with the rest, named to the model so it reports the gap. Only an unreachable
roster stops the turn, and a name collision stays fatal. Invocation failures give
the neutral retry reply, and MCP error results stay available as grounded data.

## Sirens Echo issue ownership

Deploy fixes the Sirens Echo Forgejo MCP guardfile to
`coilyco-gaming/sirens-echo`. The published surface includes issue and label
reads, issue creation and closing, comment creation, and label add, replace,
and remove. There is no owner or repository argument to redirect. There is no
issue-body edit, comment edit, delete, reopen, pin, release, pull-request,
repository, organization, or account tool.

The community definition names that server as `issue_tracker`. Its automatic
knowledge-gap reporter calls `list_issue` and `create_issue` through the
MCP's matching HTTP tool API. Echo keeps exact-title reuse and sanitized
unlabeled creation without holding a Forgejo credential.

The CoilyCo definition reaches the same server but does not inherit that
automatic action path, because it names no `issue_tracker`. Future tools belong
in its tracked roster only after their scope and authority are explicitly
reviewed.

## Acceptance coverage

The official in-process MCP fixture proves schema discovery, a tool-call-only
first model response, complete tool result continuation, a grounded
user-facing reply, and alternate compatible content forms. Separate profile
tests prove the CoilyCo definition selects exactly its Steam and Forgejo
surfaces, resolves both addresses from deployment rather than a literal URL, and
names no issue tracker.

The live Echo evaluation selects only static MCP URLs, then requires an
`eco__get_eco_server_status` call without sending Discord or Forgejo writes.
